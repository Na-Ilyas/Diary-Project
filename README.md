# Diary-Project
This is a small Diary project that saves your notes in a txt file format within the real time date. It has 4 functions, namely:
add note
read note with the specific date
read all notes
delete a note.
I hope it helps.
P.S: Select first mention of the "Change here" file and then press ctrl+shift+L command and paste your own path to your txt file
